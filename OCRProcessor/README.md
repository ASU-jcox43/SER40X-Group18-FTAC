# üß† OCR Processor

This project extracts and processes text from PDF files using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.  
It supports both **scanned PDFs** (via Tesseract OCR) and **text-based PDFs** (via PyMuPDF).  
The output is organized into structured **JSON** files, separating text by sections.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment 
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment
MacOS/Linux: ```bash source venv/bin/activate```
Windows: ```bash venv\Scripts\activate```

### 4. Install all dependencies from requirements text
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
